abstract="AbstractAn integrated-electro-hydraulic brake system (I-EHB) is presented to fulfill the requirements of active safety. Because I-EHB can control the brake pressure accurately and fast. Furthermore I-EHB is a decoupled system, so it could make the maximum regenerative braking while offers the same brake pedal feeling and also good for ADAS and unmanned driving application. Based on the analysis of current electrohydraulic brake systems, regulation requirements and the requirements for brake system, the operating mode requirements of I-EHB are formed. Furthermore, system topological structure and a conceptual design are proposed. After the selection of key components, the parameter design is accomplished by modeling the system. According to the above-mentioned design method, an I-EHB prototype and test rig is made. Through the test rig, characteristics of the system are tested. Results show that this I-EHB system responded rapidly. Upon the experimental results, increasing pressure response time (T90) of I-EHB is 53% shorter than that of conventional brake system and reducing pressure response time (T10) of I-EHB is 70% shorter than that of conventional brake system. The tracking performance of I-EHB is accurate enough. The RMS (root mean square) of tracking error are 1.99 bar and 1.43 bar according to different aim signals. The experimental results proved that I-EHB fulfills the requirements of active safety.",

abstract="A disk brake clamp force controller for electromechanical brakes (EMB) in automotive brake-by-wire systems may be obtained from a standard motion control architecture with cascaded position, speed and current control loops by replacing the outer position control loop with a force control loop. When implemented with proportional, integral and differential (PID) controllers this architecture generally performs well for standard motion control problems, but the EMB control problem is differentiated by a large operating range in which non-linear load disturbances such as friction become significant at high clamp forces of up to 30kN. This paper investigates the feasibility of a cascaded PI control architecture for an EMB with the intention of establishing a baseline standard against which the performance of future control schemes may be compared. Simulation results are presented based on an accepted EMB model.",

abstract={Smaller locomotives often use mechanical transmissions instead of diesel-electric drive systems typically used in larger locomotives. This paper discusses how Model Based Design was used to develop the complete drive train control system for a 24 ton sugar cane locomotive. A complete MATLAB Simulink machine model was built to fully test and verify the shift control logic, traction control, vehicle speed limiting, and braking control for this locomotive application before it was commissioned. The model included the engine, torque converter, planetary transmission, drive line, and steel on steel driving surface. Simulation was used to debug all control code and test and refine control strategies so that the initial field commissioning in remote Australia was executed very quickly with minimal engineering support required. The Caterpillar approach to plant modeling with proprietary library of Simulink component models will also be discussed in this paper since it enabled the rapid construction of an accurate locomotive plant model.}
